## Old Questions, Hard Answers

Like the majority of people, the last few years in the post COVID world have been difficult ones. Near the end of the pandemic -my senior year of highschool- I got very sick. While it took a while to figure out what exactly was wrong, it was clear I was having a bad autoimmune response. I had to take about half of my senior year off, which was not particularly good for my grades, mental health, or life as a whole. After I recovered, I quickly realized that while I might be "better", I am not where I was mentally or physically before I got sick, needing to sleep far more, and still having bad immune reactions to any sort of sickness. I quickly found similar symptoms, explained as brain fog, autoimmune fatigue, and a host of other similar jargon, what I didn't find was a solution. It became rather apparent that my concrete plan through the next years, which had gone unrattled by the global pandemic, was not going to continue to work. Where I used to rely on memory, I now had to develop a system of order completely foregin to me. Where before I could simply do school work whenever I was motivated, I now had to develop dicipline. As I purused the usual passive information gathering tools you can think of a teenage boy using, anxiously scouring youtube and instagram for the answers to better myself; I found little other then some red pill content and the occasional thousand dollar course. I had to reevaluate my process.
