**Hello, world!**

Hi, my name's Elliot. I'm an engineering student, resturaunt worker, lover of the outdoors, and reading, who calls the Pacific Northwest home. When I am not at school, work, outdoors, or reading, I am coding or working on personal projects to gain better skillsets in areas that interest me. The main reason I am making this blog is to write about some of these projects, the ramblings and inspirations that get me to them, and process of making (or attempting to make) these ideas a reality.
