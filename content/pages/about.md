Hello World!

My name's Elliot, I'm the president of [Pyrus](https://pyrus-cases.com), a startup developing device acessories made to reduce the negative effects of prolonged screen viewing. When I am not doing that, working my other job as a line cook, or in school for mechanical engineering, I am iether here coding, in the outdoors or gym, or reading a book [(See my reading list for the year here)]({{<ref "posts/returning-to-reading">}}). I plan on posting my projects here along with my ramblings, to give a good view of my personality and skills. I am currently learning and coding in the Rust language, as it has always interested me. I hope to have some projects on here such as a chip-8 emulator soon. 

## Contact:

You can contact me through my listed socials, or my email: ```etduncan at pyruscases dot com```

## Resume:

My resume can be seen and downloaded below using a shortcode I made, which can be seen [Here](https://github.com/velo1guy/embed-pdf-hugo-shortcode).
