Hello World!

My name's Elliot, I'm the president of [Pyrus](https://pyrus-cases.com), a startup developing device acessories made to reduce the negative effects of prolonged screen viewing. When I am not doing that, working my other job as a line cook, or in school for mechanical engineering, I am iether here coding, in the outdoors or gym, or reading a book [(See my reading list for the year here)](#). I plan on posting my projects here along with my ramblings, to give a good view of my personality and skills. I am currently learning and coding in the Rust language, as it has always interested me. I hope to have some projects on here such as a chip-8 emulator soon. My resume can be seen [Here]().
